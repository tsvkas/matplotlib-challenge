# matplotlib-challenge

------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™ve successfully prepared all the data, merged it and created a summary statistics.

Created all the bar and pie charts, calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created a box plot.

Created a line plot and a scatter plot and calculated correlation and regression.

Wrote three observations or inferences that can be made from the data and added them to the top of my notebook.

Most of it was fairly easy to do, but got a bit stuck at the end and looked for help which was very useful.
